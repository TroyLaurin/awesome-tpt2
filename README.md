# AI scripts for use in The Perfect Tower 2
https://games.fs-studios.com/games/perfecttower2

All of these scripts use relative screen positioning - the bottom left of the screen is `(0.0,0.0)`, and the top right of the screen is `(1.0,1.0)` - think of it as a percentage distance of the screen size.  To use these scripts requires modifying the below script and setting your own screen coordinates for `XMAX` and `YMAX`:
```

```

Many thanks need to go to the discord users for either directly contributing scripts, or making the scripts possible through discussion.  A link to the discord can be found on the game website.
